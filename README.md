## Overview

Welcome to the Rails Debugging Lab! This lab is designed to enhance your understanding of Ruby on Rails by presenting you with a series of intentionally introduced bugs, issues, and challenges within a pre-built Rails application. Your task is to identify, debug, and fix these issues, applying best practices and reinforcing your knowledge of Rails' structure and operation.

## Objectives

- **Debugging Skills:** Improve your ability to diagnose and fix common Rails errors.
- **Rails Fundamentals:** Deepen your understanding of MVC architecture, routing, migrations, ActiveRecord, and more.
- **Problem-Solving:** Enhance your problem-solving skills in a real-world context.
- **Best Practices:** Learn best practices for writing clean, efficient, and secure Rails code.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Islamsulaiman/fishing_bugs.git
    cd fishing_bugs
    ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**

    Make sure you have Ruby, Rails, and Bundler installed. Then, run:

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

3. **Database Setup:**

    Run the following commands to set up your database:

    ```bash
